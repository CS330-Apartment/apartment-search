# Apartment Search
##### by Damon D'Amico and Andrew Liao
## The Problem
The problem that our project would tackle is helping college students find off-campus housing. In many colleges in the United States, most schools require students to stay for on-campus housing for at least two years. After the sophomore year, students are generally given the option to live off-campus, which can be beneficial to students because of the cheaper cost compared to on-campus housing. However, currently there aren’t many websites for apartment search, especially when it comes to housing for students. Many students complain about monotonous process leading to unsatisfactory results from the search. The problem stems from a lack of apartments available on the online listings. Many of these apartments available may only be placed in listings on a paper placed around the school or be posted in a non-centralized online groups like on Facebook groups, which makes it very hard for the majority of students to find out about it. Another reason is that many of the apartments listed on apartment search websites do not have a filter that states it allows the apartment to rented out during the school year. This is because many landlords prefer to lease out their apartments for long-term commitments. Due to the lack of this filter, students have to go through all the listings in hope of finding a cheap apartment as well as one willing to lease out for just for the school year. Our project’s goal is to provide a website that provides a platform that is geared towards providing university students listings available only to college students. This will reduce the tediousness of finding out all the details for an apartment search to help out students.  
#### Existing Products
Many websites have done a lot of work on filters, in which they try to add different types of filters to meet the needs of different types of customers. Apartment.com is a typical one among these websites, which provides a variety of filtering options. Their filter covers different kinds of needs, including car parking, clothes washing and swimming etc. In addition, some websites, such as Zillow.com, support users to search for listings by zip code, which also plays a good filtering role to a certain extent.
## User Research
From user research, we hoped to learn more about the process of searching for an apartment from a student’s perspective. We wanted to see what problems exist in searching for off-campus housing and how we can improve the process.
#### Our Research Approach
Being undergraduate students ourselves, we had many potential users around us. We interviewed fellow Northwestern students to determine what features would be necessary for a student housing application. We asked them specifically about their experiences finding off campus housing. We wanted to know how people get information on available housing, what avenues students currently use, what problems or concerns people have with the apartment search process, and what apartment features people consider most when making housing decisions. We prepared a script of questions to ask potential users, and interviewed Northwestern students of all ages.
#### What We Learned
We found several key takeaways throughout our interview process. Currently, students want more available information on current listings, and a better, more centralized location to find this information. Most students we interviewed reported that they heard about apartments solely through word of mouth, which seemed strange to us with all of the online tools available. They also stressed that they would only use a solution that was easy to use and had a low time commitment. Some students reported finding their apartments by walking around town and looking for "For Rent" signs, wasting all of their time. Lastly, while the students we talked to sought different features in a living space, they all wanted the ability to sort available listings via features like cost, location, and available amenities.
## Paper Prototyping
#### A screenshot or embedded video clip of your paper prototype
#### How your concept was received by testers, and and usability problems
#### What directions you pursued based on what you learned (resolutions)

## High-Fidelity Prototyping
#### A description of the tasks you decided to support. This should include screenshots of your app, with an explanation of how the various app features were intended to support the task.
The first task is when someone wants to find off-campus housing for final two years of undergraduate and wants their apartment to have certain features.


To help implement this task we created a filter section on the right side of the website. To filter by amenities, the user would just need to check off the boxes and press the submit button. Afterwards, the listings page would filter based on the amenities.



The second task occurs in the situation where after two years, the same person wants to give a fair review of place for future students.



To implement this task, the app features we added was modal in the first listing card. When you click on the first listing a modal page will pop up and this provides extra information for the listing. These include who the listing is sold by as well as images of the listing. On the bottom section, we have the comment section for the second task. This is where it allows users to comment and give a fair review of the listing they previously used.

#### A description of your three components you chose to implement (2 for us since we only have 2 people)
The two components that we chose to implement are the data filter selection and the social interactions comments section. For the data filter selection, we had a filter with checkboxes. The checkboxes that the users would check indicated the type of amenities that they wanted in their listings. The other component that we implemented was the social interactions component. For this components we added a modal for the user on the first listing. In the modal it included additional information of the listing and pictures as well as a place for comments from the user.
## Reflection
#### What you managed to accomplish in the time you had
We managed to get a simple working prototype of our idea. The website currrently filters options of listings and shows one modal that contains more information about the listing. On the modal it also includes a comments sections for users to post about the listing. There is also a somewhat representational version of another filter that will filter the listings by the university on the header. Overall the website works, is simple,  and has the 2 components working for the assignment.
#### What the next steps of your app would be if you had more time
If we had more time we would finish the additional filter for the universities. Afterwards we would imporve the listing cards aesthically. We would try to made the website look visually more friendly for users.

#### Instructions for running your app (including how your prototype is best viewed).
The prototype is best viewed using Google Chrome on Mac. To run the app and to test the prototype components, you first should first click the "Select your university" button and click one of the options listed. This will pop up and fill the listings page with the potential listings. For our first component click on the first listing and it will pop up a modal. You can scroll through changes and add a comments. Afterwards you can filter the selections on the left side  by the amenities you want in your listings. Click submit and all the listings will be filtered.
